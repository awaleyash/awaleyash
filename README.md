- 👋 Hello, I’m @awaleyash.
- 👀 I’m interested in tweaking things around.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning different things, sometimes those grow into something worthwhile
   and sometimes not, well lets be honest- mostly not. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects.
- 📫 People can reach me on 'awaleyash@gmail.com'
- ⚡ Information: I live in India. I have done my bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering.
  Currently (that is on 30-03-2024), working as Senior Systems Engineer with one of the major IT company out of India.
